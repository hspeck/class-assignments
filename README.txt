at 6:32 Weds 1/24/17 I am trying to solve a corruption issue and consolidate my classwork_v2 directory with the original class work directory

Prior to this I absentmindedly deleted the files from class "badly" "named" and "file.txt", but they should still be in my git history.

At 6:42 I successfuly took the git from the remote repo and put it in the local repo and then commited the local changes to the remote.

I will now consolodate the changes with classwork_v2
